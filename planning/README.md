# `deterministicPlanning.py`

## Exercise 0 - Look at the input format

### Look at a map definition file

Take a look at a few.  Do you see any you recognize?

### Look at a scenario definition file

Do all the parts make sense?

## Exercise 1 - Solve one of the supplied pathfinding problems

* Start by invoking `deterministicPlanning.py` directly
  * This will run on `AR0011SR.map.scen`
* Pick a few different maps
* Pick a few different scenarios
* Look at the timing output
  * What appears to make a problem hard?

## Exercise 2 - Create a new scenario on an existing map
* Try to modify an existing scenario
  * Make the path shorter
  * Make the path longer
* Can you intentionally affect the run time of the algorithm?
  * What tends to make things the hardest?

## Exercise 3 - Build your own map and solve some pathfinding problems on it

# `stochasticPlanning.py`

## Exercise 0 - Run the Cart Pole Exercise with the default settings

## Exercise 1 - Play around with Cart Pole Hash and Shape It

## Exercise 2 - Run Mountain Car exercise with default settings

## Exercise 3 - Play around with Mountain Car State Hash and Shape It
